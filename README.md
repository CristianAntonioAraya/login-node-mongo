# **Login Server using Node MongoDB**

_This application was made as a test of development skills._ 🧑‍💻

You can see the app in production [Go To App!](https://login-node-mongo-production-cb8e.up.railway.app/)

The purpose of this application is to be able to log in and register a user in a database, passing a security and verification layer and encrypting sensitive information.

## Description 📓

The server was built using `node`, `express`, `mongoose` and `mongodb`.

`mongodb` is a non-relational document-based database, but the solution created in this example accepts any other database like mySql, postgreSql
